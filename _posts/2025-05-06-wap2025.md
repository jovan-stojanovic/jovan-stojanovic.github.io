At the WAP 2025 Conference held at the Bordeaux School of Economics, I gave a presentation of my working paper "Politicians’ Social Media Discourse Strategies: Evidence from Twitter and the French 2022 Legislative".

### Abstract:
This paper explores how politicians strategically adapt their social media discourse over the course of the electoral cycle. Exploring a unique dataset that combines Twitter and administrative information, we use machine learning techniques to analyze more than 750,000 tweets published by 3,701 French politicians before and around the 2022 legislative elections. We show that during the campaign, candidates increase their posting rates on Twitter and strategically select the topics they address. However, the effects vary across political coalitions and reflect the candidates' ideological positions.
