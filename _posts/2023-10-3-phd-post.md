I am happy to announce that I will be a PhD Candidate at Inria and Université Paris-Saclay for the next three years.

#### I will be working on:
<ul>
    <li>networks</li>
    <li>econometrics</li>
    <li>machine learning</li>
</ul>

I will be posting news on this website.

<blockquote>
    The master-economist must possess a rare combination of gifts. He must be mathematician, historian, statesman, philosopher — in some degree. He must understand symbols and speak in words. He must contemplate the particular, in terms of the general, and touch abstract and concrete in the same flight of thought. He must study the present in the light of the past for the purposes of the future. No part of man's nature or his institutions must be entirely outside his regard. He must be purposeful and disinterested in a simultaneous mood, as aloof and incorruptible as an artist, yet sometimes as near to earth as a politician.

    —John Maynard Keynes
