I will be attending the Journées de Microéconomie Appliquée 2025 conference in Poitiers to present my work on strategic political discourse on Twitter during the 2022 legislative elections.

The keynote speaker will be [Clément de Chaisemartin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MwHeROkAAAAJ&hl=en), who will lead a training day on difference in differences methods.

Looking forward to this event and hope to see you there!
