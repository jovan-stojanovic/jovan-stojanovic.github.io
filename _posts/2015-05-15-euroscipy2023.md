### Abstract:
Are you wondering what to do with all of the tables you have? And how to make sense of all of the dirty data?

Data science is increasingly faced with multiple-sourced, non-standardized dirty tables.

We have what you need: skrub is a Python package for preparing your dirty tables for machine learning!

dirty-cat evolves into skrub and gives you the right tools to clean, transform and join your tables for machine learning.
